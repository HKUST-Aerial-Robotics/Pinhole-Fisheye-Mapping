# Pinhole-Fisheye-Mapping: Fisheye Branch
## A monocular dense mapping system for pinhole and fisheye cameras

This is a monocular dense mapping system following the IROS 2018 submission **Adaptive Baseline Monocular Dense Mapping with Inter-frame Depth Propagation**, Kaixuan Wang, Shaojie Shen. The implementation will be open source after the acceptance of the paper.

Benefiting from the proposed adaptive baseline matching cost computation, belief propagation based depth extraction and depth refinement using inter-frame propagated depth filter, our system can generate high-quality depth maps in real-time using a pinhole or a fisheye camera.

An example of the system output is shown:

A video can be used to illustrate the pipeline and the performance of our system:

## 0.0 Disclaimer

Here, we provide an open source version of the pinhole depth map estimation. Due to the complexity of the system, we cannot provide all supports if you want to use it in your projects.

## 1.0 Prerequisites
+ **OpenCV**
+ **Eigen**
+ **CUDA**

Here we use CUDA 8.0. CUDA 9.0 has not been tested.

## 2.0 Download the rosbag

We provide an example rosbag for you to test the project via [the link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xuae1kxuulcf11z/open_quadtree_mapping.bag?dl=0).

## 3.0 Run the code

### 3.1 Download the code 

Move the rospackage ```pinhole_mapping``` into the ```catkin_ws/src```.

Change the line 29 and the line 30 in the ```CMakeLists.txt``` according your GPU device.

### 3.2 Compile

Just ```catkin_make``` in the ```catkin_ws```.

### 3.3 Run!

Just

```roslaunch pinhole_mapping example.launch``` and play the rosbag you downloaded.

 The depth map is published in ```/pinhole_mapping/col_depth```.
 
## 4.0 Acknowledgement

As you may find out, we use many codes from [REMODE](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_open_remode) to develop the project. Thanks a lot!
